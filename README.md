# "Ethically Making & Sharing Data"
A workshop offered by Cynthia Heider at Penn Libraries

## Description 
What are some of the ethical challenges researchers face when choosing to work with data? This session will help you assess the potential benefits and risks of collecting, analyzing, and sharing data and provide you with some practical tools to help you assess data needs and assume an ethical data practice in your next project. Humanists especially welcome!
